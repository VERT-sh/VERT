We decided to solve this problem once and for all by making an alternative that solves all those problems, and more.<br/><br/>All non-video files are converted completely on-device; this means that there's no delay between sending and receiving the files from a server, and we never get to snoop on the files you convert.<br/><br/>Video files get uploaded to our lightning-fast RTX 4000 Ada server. Your videos stay on there for an hour if you do not convert them. If you do convert the file, the video will stay on the server for an hour, or until it is downloaded. The file will then be deleted from our server."
